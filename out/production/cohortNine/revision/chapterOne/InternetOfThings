The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

How does IoT work?
An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded systems, such as processors, sensors and communication hardware, to collect, send and act on data they acquire from their environments. IoT devices share the sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or other edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally

Some of the advantages of IoT include the following:
ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device;
improved communication between connected electronic devices;
transferring data packets over a connected network saving time and money; and
automating tasks helping to improve the quality of a business's services and reducing the need for human intervention.

ways the Internet of Things is improving our lives

1. Smarter cities

More than half of the world's population now lives in cities—up from just 34% in the 1960s. By mid-century that figure could reach 66% according to the United Nations. Cities are major contributors to climate change, and some are already feeling its impact through rising sea levels and increasingly severe weather events.

2. Cleaner air and water

The Internet of Things can help cities improve public health. Dirty air and water led to a staggering 9 million deaths in 2015 alone, according to a recent study. Cities suffering from chronic pollution, such as Delhi and Beijing, are beginning to deploy sensor networks designed to alert residents when levels are dangerously high.

3. Smarter agriculture

From massive agribusiness players like Cargill to small organic farmers, growers all over the world are using the Internet of Things to reduce their consumption of water and fertilizers, cut waste and improve the quality or yield of their products.

4. Cutting food waste

Around one third of all food produced for human consumption every year is lost or wasted somewhere along the supply chain, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. That's 1.4 billion tons of lost nutrition for a growing planet. The Internet of Things can minimize crop losses and increase productivity.

5. Connecting patients

The Internet of Things can transform the healthcare industry by helping doctors gain faster access to patients’ data. Wearable, Internet-connected sensor devices that track a patient’s heart rate, pulse, or even blood pressure are increasingly affordable, compact and accurate. While there is still some debate over how to safely collect, transmit and use this data, wearables are one of the most promising IoT applications in healthcare.

6. Fighting breast cancer

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women. While screening and treatments have improved survival rates, traditional mammography may not detect a tumor until the disease is advanced. The iTBra, developed by Cyrcadia Health, could help doctors diagnose breast cancer much faster. It consists of two breast patches with embedded sensors that track temperature changes in breast tissue over time.
